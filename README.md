# Hello there!

My name is Pranav M. I'm an enthusiast of open hardware and RISC-V.  
My areas of interest lie in SoCs, CPUs, and microarchitecture — mostly in Bluespec, Verilog, and sometimes Rust.  
I've spent a good amount of time working with FPGAs and writing RTL, and now I'm building on that foundation by bringing in embedded systems and computer architecture to create functional systems.

I care about writing clean RTL, building stuff that boots real code, and understanding how real chips work from the ground up.  
Sometimes I blog, sometimes I draw, sometimes I go take nature photos.
